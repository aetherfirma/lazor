Lazor
=====

A tool for processing raw DXF files into laser ready files, removing duplicate items and adding tabs where required.

Please note, this has been designed to ingest files as generated by sketchup in my particular workflow. It is not a general purpose tool (yet). It is likely to be poorly tested (A lot of functionality has been achieved through trial and error) and likely have some weird assumptions encoded within it.
